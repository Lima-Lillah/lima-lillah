<h1><center><font color="white">WELCOME TO MY WEBPAGE</font></center></h1>

<p style="font-size: larger;">You are welcome to my webpage where you will have ultimate chance to read about me and my business. If you are here, congratulation. By the way, i am also happy to have you here on my webpage and as you read through the content of the pages, i wish you goodluck in life and hereafter.</p>

<h2><center><font color="white">BRIEF TALK ABOUT HEREAFTER</font></center></h2>
<p style="font-size: larger;"> <strong>Yes! Hereafter. You must be wondering what that means right? Or perphaps, you already know about it, all the same, i will like to tell you little about it because i really like talking about it so much. Hereafter is like a permanent hometown for every human being where things are totally free there unlike this life where we have to strive for our survival. Cool it is right? But there is a little to no problem, you need to have an access code to enter this place and enjoy endless pleasure. If you notice, in life, there are lots of possibilities whereby you can choose to do this and choose not to do this. Many think this is just normal but it is not because this big universe is like an exam hall for human being where every individual are passing through their exam and the better you pass, the better your hereafter will be. Amoong the possibilities in life is the choice of religion and this is the biggest of all because it is what define under which access code you are working into. You can be working under a bad access code and when you reach your hereafter and your access code is been scanned, you will be granted into an unexplainable location "HellFire" due to the bad access code you have worked for. Who should you blaim, yourself right? Well talking about hereafter is something big but i can only advice you to checkout for ISLAM as this is the most valid access code available in the whole universe in order for you to be granted an unlimited enjoyment in your hereafter. Goodluck! </strong></font></p>

<h2><center><font color="white">ABOUT MYSELF</font></center></h2>
<p style="font-size: large;"><font color="black"> <strong> You dont even ask about me or maybe you know me well before ? Well i will be telling you about myself now. My name is HAMMED RAZAQ OLANSILE, i was born on the 12th of Febraury in the 1990s. I was born and raised in Ibadan, Oyo State. I am light in complexion, not too tall and not too fat as you can also see that on my webpage background. i finished my primary school certificate in a community school in Ibadan and also attented a community school for my SSCE certificate and finished SSCE in the year 2014/2015. After my SSCE, my Dad, the best man in the whole world instructed me to start my main life purpose journey which is to worship the most high (ALLAH) because no matter how successful you are in life journey, if your main purpose is not well acheived, you will have a bad access code in your hereafter and will end up in HellFire after your death since no escape root from death. So, i started the journey to firstly know about this almighty creator of this big exam hall(LIFE) by going to a modrasat call DAHAW ISLAMIC PREACHING SCHOOL in Ibadan which ive spent about 6years there and still remain about 3 years to go. While passing through this ultimate journey, i forget not about LIFE acheivement itself and i started doing business with my brother as well as learning how to repair computer system for about 3 years then, i recalled my western education life and planned to further more after 2 more years of doing business. I registered of A'Level program called IJMBE with Pythagoras Academy Studies in Ilorin and acquired 11pts/16pts after its exam. I was very happy to have this result because i couldnt imagine it, i have left this line for over 5years and i still have this? The power of focus got executed, alhamdulillah. Nothing else than to pick a university to further more after A'Level and with many advices, i picked Kwara State University and Alhikmah University. Both university offered me admission but i chose KWASU, the world class university because it is a state university and as this saying goes in Nigeria, it is better not to waste money on educationin Nigeria because na SCAM. As at the time of creating this webpage 21/04/2021, i am now a 200L student of KWASU studying Computer Science. I wish every of my mates success in their Studies and thanks to our lecturers, may the almighty reward your effort. </strong></font></p>
